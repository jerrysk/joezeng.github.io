## How To Play

In this version of the game, the board is now 5 by 5 instead of 4 by 4. Also, **any number of** tiles in a row will merge into one, not just two. You are trying to create 144, which is only possible by merging 3 in a row a few times, which is considerably harder to do on purpose than just two.
